This project presents a brief study of the Marshall--Olkin Generalized Exponential
(MOGE) distribution, a flexible three-parameter lifetime model obtained by applying
the Marshall--Olkin method to the Generalized Exponential distribution. We first
review the motivation and theoretical properties of the MOGE model, highlighting its
ability to capture a wide range of hazard-rate shapes, including increasing, decreasing,
bathtub-shaped and inverted-bathtub patterns.

We then focus on parameter estimation using the Expectation--Maximization (EM)
algorithm. The EM procedure is implemented and its performance is investigated
through a simulation study under different parameter settings and sample sizes. A real
data set is also analysed to illustrate the practical usefulness of the MOGE model.
The results suggest that the MOGE distribution is a promising alternative to classical
lifetime models, especially when data exhibit non-standard hazard-rate behaviour.
