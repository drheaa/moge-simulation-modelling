\chapter{Model Description}

This chapter presents the full mathematical formulation of the Marshall--Olkin Generalized Exponential (MOGE) distribution, including the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) as introduced by Ristić and Kundu (2015).

\section{Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)}

The MOGE distribution is defined through the following CDF:
\[
G(x;\alpha,\lambda,\theta)
=
\frac{
\left( 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \right)^{\alpha}
}{
\theta + (1-\theta)
\left( 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \right)^{\alpha}
}.
\]
This expression appears as Equation (1) of the original paper.

\section{Probability Density Function (PDF)}

Differentiating $G(x)$ with respect to $x$ yields the PDF of the MOGE distribution:
\[
g(x;\alpha,\lambda,\theta)
=
\frac{
\alpha \lambda \theta
e^{-\lambda x}
\left(1 - e^{-\lambda x}\right)^{\alpha - 1}
}{
\left[
\theta + (1-\theta)
\left(1 - e^{-\lambda x}\right)^{\alpha}
\right]^2
}.
\]
This matches Equation (2) of the 2015 paper.

These two equations form the basis for all further developments in estimation, EM algorithm derivations, simulation work, and data analysis in later chapters.
